# odin-admin-dashboard

This project was created as part of the Odin Project curriculum as a way to showcase my skillset in CSS grid. I challenged myself to recreate the following screenshot as closely as possible: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png

The page is somewhat responsive, but it is optimized for viewing on desktop.
